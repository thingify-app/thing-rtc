# thing-rtc

ThingRTC is a platform for simplifying peer-to-peer communication between
devices and browsers using WebRTC.

It includes a web library for browsers, a Go library for devices,
pairing/signalling server implementations, and examples for each of these.

A pairing and signalling protocol is implemented to allow pairing of devices
without sign-in.
